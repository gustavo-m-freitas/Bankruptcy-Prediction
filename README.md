# üìä Bankruptcy Prediction  
### Predicting Corporate Financial Distress with Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project is a **Data Science portfolio** piece focused on **predicting corporate bankruptcy** using **financial data and machine learning techniques**. The goal is to develop a scalable and interpretable model to assess financial risk and help investors, analysts, and decision-makers prevent financial losses.  

This **Data Science portfolio project** is inspired by the methodology proposed in the research paper **"Financial Ratios and Corporate Governance Indicators in Bankruptcy Prediction: A Comprehensive Study"**, published in the **European Journal of Operational Research**. The study, conducted by **Deron Liang, Chia-Chi Lu, Chih-Fong Tsai, and Guan-An Shih** from **National Central University, Taiwan**, explores the use of financial ratios (FRs) and corporate governance indicators (CGIs) for predicting bankruptcy.  The **methodology employed in this portfolio** aligns with the structured approach of **Liang et al. (2016)** in predicting bankruptcy using **FRs**. The **feature selection, preprocessing techniques, and modeling strategies** are adapted to incorporate **best practices** from the study while ensuring **applicability to modern machine learning methods**.  

Additionally, this project compares **the original research-based model** with **other state-of-the-art machine learning models**, including **Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, to evaluate different approaches in bankruptcy prediction.

## ‚öñ Model Comparison: Research Paper vs. New Approaches  
This project evaluates two different **bankruptcy prediction strategies**:  

**Paper Model (Liang et al., 2016)**  
**Stratified Sampling + Feature Selection**  
**85% Recall (Detects More Bankruptcies)**  
**Lower False Negatives (~14-15%)**  

**New Models (SMOTE + Cross-Validation)**  
**Higher Accuracy (~95%) but Fails at Detecting Bankruptcies**  
**High False Negatives (~48-50%) ‚Üí Nearly Half of Bankruptcies Are Missed**  
**Low Precision (~0.39 for XGBoost, 0.36 for RF)**  

üîé **Key Finding:** The **paper‚Äôs methodology performs better in real-world financial risk assessment**, as it prioritizes **recall over accuracy**.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Used
The following **classification algorithms** were implemented and evaluated:

- **Random Forest**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**

## üìâ Evaluation Metrics
The models were assessed using the following key **performance metrics**:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Proportion of predicted bankrupt companies that were actually bankrupt.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual bankrupt companies correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, balancing both.
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Measures the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Type I Error (False Negative Rate - FN Rate)**: Percentage of bankrupt companies incorrectly classified as non-bankrupt.
- **Type II Error (False Positive Rate - FP Rate)**: Percentage of non-bankrupt companies incorrectly classified as bankrupt.

## Conclusion  
In **bankruptcy prediction**, minimizing **False Negatives (FN)** is more critical than achieving high accuracy. This study demonstrates how a **data-driven approach** can improve financial risk assessment, balancing **predictive power and interpretability**.  

**The research-based models (Liang et al., 2016) proved to be more effective in identifying bankruptcies, making them a better choice for real-world financial risk analysis.**
