# 📊 Bankruptcy Prediction  
### Predicting Corporate Financial Distress with Machine Learning  

## 🏆 Overview  
This project is a **Data Science portfolio** piece focused on **predicting corporate bankruptcy** using **financial data and machine learning techniques**. The goal is to develop a **scalable and interpretable model** to assess **financial risk** and help **investors, analysts, and decision-makers** prevent financial losses.  

This **Data Science portfolio project** is inspired by the methodology proposed in the research paper **"Financial Ratios and Corporate Governance Indicators in Bankruptcy Prediction: A Comprehensive Study"**, published in the **European Journal of Operational Research**. The study, conducted by **Deron Liang, Chia-Chi Lu, Chih-Fong Tsai, and Guan-An Shih** from **National Central University, Taiwan**, explores the use of **financial ratios (FRs) and corporate governance indicators (CGIs)** for predicting bankruptcy.  The **methodology employed in this portfolio** aligns with the structured approach of **Liang et al. (2016)** in predicting bankruptcy using **FRs and CGIs**. The **feature selection, preprocessing techniques, and modeling strategies** are adapted to incorporate **best practices** from the study while ensuring **applicability to modern machine learning methods**.  

Additionally, this project compares **the original research-based model** with **other state-of-the-art machine learning models**, including **Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, to evaluate different approaches in bankruptcy prediction.

## ⚖ Model Comparison: Research Paper vs. New Approaches  
This project evaluates two different **bankruptcy prediction strategies**:  

📖 **Paper Model (Liang et al., 2016)**  
✅ **Stratified Sampling + Feature Selection**  
✅ **85% Recall (Detects More Bankruptcies)**  
✅ **Lower False Negatives (~14-15%)**  

🚀 **New Models (SMOTE + Cross-Validation)**  
❌ **Higher Accuracy (~95%) but Fails at Detecting Bankruptcies**  
❌ **High False Negatives (~48-50%) → Nearly Half of Bankruptcies Are Missed**  
❌ **Low Precision (~0.39 for XGBoost, 0.36 for RF)**  

🔎 **Key Finding:** The **paper’s methodology performs better in real-world financial risk assessment**, as it prioritizes **recall over accuracy**.
